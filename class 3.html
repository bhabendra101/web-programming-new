 <dt> Ramen</dt>



 <dd>The word ramen first appeared in Japan in Seiichi Yoshida's How to Prepare Delicious and Economical Chinese Dishes (1928). In the book, Yoshida describes how to make ramen using flour and kansui, kneading it by hand, and stretching it with an illustration. He also states that ramen is better suited for soup or cold noodles than for baked noodles. In this case, however, ramen refers to Chinese noodles, not the dish. The first mention of ramen as a dish appears in Hatsuko Kuroda's Enjoyable Home Cooking (1947)

Early ramen or ramen-like dishes went by different names, such as Nankin soba, lit. 'Nanjing noodles'), named after the city which was the then capital of China), Shina soba lit. 'Chinese noodles') or soba, lit. 'Chinese noodles'). For example, in 1903, in Yokohama Chinatown (then known as Nanjing Town), there was a Nanjing noodle restauran , Nankin soba dokoro.

Until the 1950s, ramen was most commonly called Shina soba, but today Chūka soba or just ramen are more common, as the word Shina, meaning 'China') has acquired a pejorative connotation through its association with Japanese imperialism.

<dt> Kyoto University </dt>



 <dd>Kyoto University was established in 1897 as Japan's second imperial university. At that time, the role of science and technology in society was rapidly expanding, and momentum was being gained by the idea that universities should not only be responsible for education, but should also pursue research. Since its establishment, Kyoto University has pursued its core mission of contributing to harmonious coexistence within the global community by promoting original and creative research, creating new intellectual values, and fostering capable human resources who can generate such new values. In its pursuit of that mission, the University has made significant achievements as one of Japan's leading research-oriented universities. Those achievements are testified by the fact that Kyoto University has produced more Nobel Prize- and Fields Medal-winning research than any other university in Asia. The University has also been exploring new avenues of development since its appointment by the Japanese government as a Designated National University in 2017.
