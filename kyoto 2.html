<h2>Anciant Capital of japan</h2>
<p>
Kyoto was the capital of Japan for over 1,000 years, beginning in 794, when Emperor Kammu made the city the seat of his Imperial court and the center of Japan's political world. This long and prestigious history led to the development of many of the refined arts we now associate with Japan.
